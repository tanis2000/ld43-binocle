## How to play

Santa has been kidnapped and kept away in a tower by the evil witch of Halloween. She's jealous of Santa and wants to take all the gifts to children herself.
But she still needs Santa to get them ready. It's your mission, as Santa, to get the toys, put them in the packages and wrap them up and deliver to the elves who will take care of filling the sled. You have to wrap up enough gifts or the witch will come and sacrifice a Christmas elf to punish you!

* Use the `arrow keys` to **move**
* `UP` to **jump**
* `SPACE` to **interact** with the toys, boxes, wraps and elves. 

Pick up the toy, bring it to the box and put it in there.
Then wrap up the box and bring it to an elf. The elf will take care of delivering it to the sled. Hurry up!
